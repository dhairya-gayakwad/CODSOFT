#Task 4 <b>Rock-Paper-Scissors Game<b>

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Python. The game allows users to play multiple rounds against the computer, with the scores being tracked throughout. The user-friendly interface provides clear instructions and feedback after each round.

<ul>
<li><b>User Input:</b> Prompt the user to choose between rock, paper, or scissors.</li>
<li><b>Computer Selection:</b> The computer randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors.</li>
<li><b>Game Logic:</b> Determine the winner based on the rules:</li>
  <ul>
	<li>Rock beats scissors</li>
	<li>Scissors beat paper</li>
	<li>Paper beats rock</li>
  </ul>
<li><b>Display Result:</b> Show the user's choice and the computer's choice, and display the result of the round.</li>
<li><b>Score Tracking:</b> Keep track of the user's and computer's scores across multiple rounds.</li>

</ul>
